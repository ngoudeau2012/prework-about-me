      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Whats up, whats up, my name is Nicholas Goudeau, but I Nick. I've got a double major in Finance and Economics, two dogs, and I'm really goofy. I love music, basketball, sports, and cooking. My biggest life accomplishment in life is loosing 100 pounds when I was about twenty-two years old. It forever changed my life and taught me lessons I'll never forget. I live life through three simple values; Humor, Balance, and Respect. I'm here to learn from everyone and to establish the best possible foundation for web developrment while having a good time. Lets have fun, and good luck in the class. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm from Houston and moved to seattle about 3 years ago. If you ever forget, I probably have a hat or shirt on that says Houston.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>Some of my favorite hobbies include, Gaming (World of Warcraft), working out (health is extremely important to me), spending time with my two puppies and girlfriend, and listening to music.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I honestly haven't figured that out yet, I know I want to develope a product that truly has an impact on people's lives across america, but I haven't narrowed it down to a specific role/company yet.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in South Park, a small neighborhood south of Seattle.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>Web development is the leading platform for all infomration to be consumed. I feel like there are alot of successful companies that dont quite understand the impact of having a easy to use interface and application can do for their customers. Not to mention being able to create anything almost out thin air is really fun.</p>
